# OSX-Nkit
An AIO toolkit for most of the Hackintosh needs.

To use this program you need to download it first. Open terminal and type :-

cd ~/Desktop

curl -o nkit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Psychic-74/OSX-Nkit/osx/nkit

chmod a+x ./nkit

Now you can use the program by passing ./nkit argument or you can copy it to /usr/loca/bin for easier access.

You can verify after copying by typing "which nkit" (Without Quotes).

Output should say "/usr/local/bin/nkit".

Please use nkit help or nkit -h for the details of the program's functions.

This toolkit was written basically for my personal use.

I will keep it updating regurarly. As and when i get time.

What this does?

This is AIO solution for almost all the things like backing up and restoring all your settings kexts and misc (You will see when you run this program)

Many functions are yet to be added.

Regards
